## Reproducing the analysis

Read this excellent analysis by Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight <http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-more-unpopular-than-clinton-is-and-that-matters/> and got curious about the results so did a quick reproduction. Was mostly interested in the R squared and p values for the regression, since with only 9 samples the material is extremely small.

## Conclusion

So as you can see below the adjusted R-squared is not bad at 0.79 and p-value at 0.0008 is good as well. Somewhat surprisingly good, as we are operating with only 9 observations. 

If we do assume that this model holds, it would predict that Clinton will win with a margin of a little more than 4%. Although the 95% prediction interval for the prediction is rather wide, from -6.2 to 14.5, which also means that a trump win is within it. If you lower the level to 62% you get the interval entirely on Clintons side. That means that as Clinton got the 9.8% advantage in favorability, the model predicts that Clinton will win 62 out of a 100 times. Which is not that different from what the FiveThirthyEight Polls Plus model forcasts at the moment.
